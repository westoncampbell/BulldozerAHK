Bulldozer
---
Bulldozer is an AutoHotkey recreation of the original Bulldozer 1, Bulldozer 2, and Bulldozer 3 games created by John 'FlyMan' Hattan ([The Code Zone](https://www.thecodezone.com/)).

Bulldozer 1 first appeared in 1994 on the CD-ROM game compilation "[24 Games for Windows 95](https://archive.org/details/24GamesForWindows95)" developed by The Code Zone for Expert Software, Inc. Bulldozer 2 became available in 2000 on "Arcade Magic", also developed for Expert Software, Inc. Bulldozer 1 & Bulldozer 2 were re-released in 2003 on "Blazing Games", a compilation of fifty games developed for Cosmi Europe, Ltd. Bulldozer 3 was completed in 2002, but remained unavailable until the 2008 release of [Bulldozer](https://www.thecodezone.com/game/bulldozer.html) which included all 180 levels from the Bulldozer game series. The 2008 version was created with Adobe Flash and is available on a variety of desktop and mobile platforms. Bulldozer is a variation of the popular [Sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban) puzzle game.

The object of Bulldozer is to push all of the rocks to the targets. Move the bulldozer using the keyboard's WASD or arrow keys. The bulldozer can only push one rock at a time, and it cannot pull rocks. You will advance to the next level when each rock has been placed on a target.

All credit goes to John Hattan for the original idea of the Bulldozer game series. This project was an exercise in GDI+ and string manipulation, and is intended to pay tribute to the game I played in my youth.
