*Be careful about pushing rocks against walls. The rock might become stuck, and you'll be forced to restart the level.*

## How To Complete a Level
Progress to the next level by moving all of the rocks on to the targets. Each level will have the same number of rocks as targets.

## Hints
Carefully plan your moves. It's easy to get stuck which may force you to restart the level.

A rock is not locked into position once it is placed on a target.
