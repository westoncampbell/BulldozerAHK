# Bulldozer Rules

## Game Objective
The object of Bulldozer is to push each rock on to a target. Progress to the next level by moving all of the rocks to the targets.

<br>

## Making a Move
Move the bulldozer using the arrow keys, or WASD keys, on your keyboard. The bulldozer can move horizontally and vertically.

The bulldozer will not move if one of the following three conditions are true:

<br>

(1) You are trying to push multiple rocks...

You can only push one rock at a time!

<br>

(2) You are pushing against a wall. . .

The bulldozer can't move through walls.

(3) You are pushing a rock against a wall. . .

Be careful about pushing rocks against walls. The rock might become stuck, and you'll be forced to restart the level.

However, it may still be possible to reach the target depending on its position.

## How To Complete a Level
The level is completed when each rock has been pushed on to a target. Each level will have the same number of rocks as targets.

<br>

## Hints
Carefully plan your moves. It is easy to get stuck which will make you have to restart the level.

A rock is not locked into position once it is placed on a target. It is okay to push rocks off a target. Sometimes you will have to!
