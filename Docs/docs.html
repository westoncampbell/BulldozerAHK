## Introduction
Bulldozer, developed for  [AutoHotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) by [Weston Campbell](mailto:westoncampbell@gmail.com?Subject=BulldozerAHK),  is a recreation of the original Bulldozer game series created by John 'FlyMan' Hattan ([The Code Zone](https://www.thecodezone.com/)).

<br>

Bulldozer 1 first appeared in 1994 on the CD-ROM game compilation "[24 Games for Windows 95](https://archive.org/details/24GamesForWindows95)" developed by [The Code Zone](https://www.thecodezone.com/) for Expert Software, Inc. Bulldozer 2 became available in 2000 on "Arcade Magic", also developed for Expert Software, Inc. Bulldozer 1 & Bulldozer 2 were re-released in 2003 on "Blazing Games", a compilation of fifty games developed for Cosmi Europe, Ltd. Bulldozer 3 was completed in 2002, but remained unavailable until the 2008 release of [Bulldozer](https://www.thecodezone.com/game/bulldozer.html) which included all 180 levels from the Bulldozer trilogy. The 2008 version was created using Adobe Flash and is available on a variety of desktop and mobile platforms. Bulldozer is a variation of the popular [Sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban) puzzle game.

<br>

All credit goes to John Hattan for the original idea of the Bulldozer game series. This project was an exercise in GDI+ and string manipulation, and is intended to pay tribute to the game I played in my youth.

## Game Objective
The object of Bulldozer is to push each rock on to a target.

<br>

[![arrow-up](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/westoncampbell/BulldozerAHK/master/Docs/Images/icons8-up-24.png)](#bulldozer-documentation)

## Movement
Move the bulldozer using the arrow keys, or WASD keys, on your keyboard. The bulldozer can move horizontally and vertically.

![Fig 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/westoncampbell/BulldozerAHK/master/Docs/Images/Fig1.png)

The bulldozer will not move if one of the following three conditions are true:

**(1) You are trying to push multiple rocks...**

![Fig 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/westoncampbell/BulldozerAHK/master/Docs/Images/Fig2.png)

> You can only push one rock at a time!

<br>

**(2) You are pushing against a wall. . .**

![Fig 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/westoncampbell/BulldozerAHK/master/Docs/Images/Fig3.png)

> The bulldozer can't move through walls.

<br>

**(3) You are pushing a rock against a wall. . .**

![Fig 4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/westoncampbell/BulldozerAHK/master/Docs/Images/Fig4.png)

> Be careful about pushing rocks against walls. The rock might become stuck, and you'll be forced to restart the level.

![Fig 5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/westoncampbell/BulldozerAHK/master/Docs/Images/Fig5.png)

> However, it may still be possible to reach the target depending on its position.

## Completing a Level
Progress to the next level by moving all of the rocks on to the targets. Each level will have the same number of rocks as targets.

<br>

## Hints
Carefully plan your moves. It's easy to get stuck which may force you to restart the level.

A rock is not locked into position once it is placed on a target.

## Custom Themes

Bulldozer supports loading custom themes from an external 480x32 PNG image file.

Each 32x32 region represents one of the 15 tiles in the game.
