# BulldozerAHK

Bulldozer is a clone of the original Bulldozer 1, Bulldozer 2, and Bulldozer 3 games created by John Hattan ([The Code Zone](https://www.thecodezone.com/)).

Bulldozer 1 first appeared on CD-ROM in 1994 on "[24 Games for Windows 95](https://archive.org/details/24GamesForWindows95)" released by Expert Software, Inc. Bulldozer 2 was included in "Arcade Magic", also released by Expert Software, Inc. Bulldozer 3 was completed in 2002, but remained unreleased until the game creator bundled all 180 of the Bulldozer levels together in the 2008 release of [Bulldozer](https://www.thecodezone.com/game/bulldozer.html). The 2008 version was created with Adobe Flash and is available on a variety of desktop and mobile platforms. Bulldozer is a variation of the popular [Sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban) puzzle game.

The object of Bulldozer is to push all of the rocks to the targets. Move the bulldozer using the keyboard's WASD or arrow keys. The bulldozer can only push one rock at a time, and it cannot pull rocks. You will advance to the next level when each rock has been placed on a target.
