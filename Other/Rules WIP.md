# Bulldozer Rules

### Game Objective
The object of Bulldozer is to push each rock on to a target. Progress to the next level by moving all of the rocks to the targets.

### Making a Move
Move the bulldozer using the arrow keys, or WASD keys, on your keyboard. The bulldozer can move horizontally and vertically.

The bulldozer will not move if one of the following three conditions are true:

(1) You are trying to push multiple rocks...

You can only push one rock at a time!

(2) You are pushing against a wall. . .

The bulldozer can't move through walls.

(3) You are pushing a rock against a wall. . .

Be careful about pushing rocks against walls.

For example, look at the following setup.  You have just pushed the rock against the wall. . .

Notice how you cannot reach the target from this position (since you can't pull the rock away from the wall) and will have to restart the level by hitting the F2 function key.

Pushing rocks against walls may be necessary.  In the following setup, you made the same move as the one described above; however, in this case you can reach the target!

### How To Complete a Level
The level is completed when each rock has been pushed on to a target. Each level will have the same number of rocks as targets.

### Hints
Carefully plan your moves. It is easy to get stuck which will make you have to restart the level.

A rock is not locked into position once it is placed on a target. It is okay to push rocks off a target. Sometimes you will have to!
