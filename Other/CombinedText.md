The bulldozer will not move if one of the following three conditions are true:

**(1) You are trying to push multiple rocks...**

*You can only push one rock at a time!*

**(2) You are pushing against a wall. . .**

**(3) You are pushing a rock against a wall. . .**

*Be careful about pushing rocks against walls. The rock might become stuck, and you'll be forced to restart the level.*

*However, it may still be possible to reach the target depending on its position.*

## Completing a Level
Progress to the next level by moving all of the rocks on to the targets. Each level will have the same number of rocks as targets.

## Hints
Carefully plan your moves. It's easy to get stuck which may force you to restart the level.

A rock is not locked into position once it is placed on a target.
