# Bulldozer Rules

### Object of the Game
The object of Bulldozer is to push each rock on to a target.  Put all the rocks on the target and progress to the next level.  See how many levels you can complete!

### Making a Move
In a move, you can direct the bulldozer horizontally (using your up and down arrow keys)  or vertically (left and right arrow keys). . .

Sometimes when you hit an arrow key, the bulldozer will not move.  Check for one of the following three conditions:

(1) You are trying to push two rocks. . .

You can only push one rock at a time!

(2) You are pushing against a wall. . .

The bulldozer cannot knock down walls.  It is your job to maneuver the rocks around the maze.

(3) You are pushing a rock against a wall. . .

Be careful about pushing rocks against walls.  For example, look at the following setup.  You have just pushed the rock against the wall. . .

Notice how you cannot reach the target from this position (since you can't pull the rock away from the wall) and will have to restart the level by hitting the F2 function key.

Pushing rocks against walls may be necessary.  In the following setup, you made the same move as the one described above; however, in this case you can reach the target!

### How To Complete a Level
The level is conquered when each rock has been pushed on to a target.  Each level will have the same number of rocks as targets.   Try to solve as many levels as you can. Bulldozer contains sixty puzzling levels!


### Hints
Carefully plan your moves.  It is easy to get stuck which will make you have to restart the level.

A rock is not locked into position once it is placed on a target.  It is okay to push rocks off a target.  Sometimes you will have to!
Keep a piece of paper handy to write down your passwords.  Passwords allow you to start at a higher level the next time you sit down to play Bulldozer.
