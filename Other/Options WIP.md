# Bulldozer Options

### How to set Options
To bring up the Options dialog box, choose the "Options..." menu item from the "Game" menu.  If any option is changed within the Option dialog box, the current game being played will be abandoned.  If you do not wish to abandon the current game, select the Cancel button and return to the game.
The Options dialog box is broken up into various sections shown by the tabs at the top of the dialog box.  Clicking on a tab shows the options available for that topic.  For example, the "Extras" tab allows you to choose the background color of the game, and to change the sound options.


#### Tab Descriptions
#####  Options Tab
* Starting Level
To change to a new level, double click in the Starting Level list box.
* Password
You will be required to enter the password when the Password dialog box pops up.  You are given a password for every fourth level you conquer.
* Current Level
The current level number is displayed in the center of the Options tab along the bottom.

#####  Pieces Tab
The Pieces tab allows you to change the appearance of the playing pieces used in the game.  The options for this tab will not affect the rules of the game; however, the look of the game pieces will change.
* Piece Names
The "Piece Set Names" list box shows the names of the various playing pieces available.  Clicking on a name in the list box selects the new game pieces and previews them in the "Piece Set Preview" area.

#####  Extras Tab
The Extras tab allows you to change the background color of the main game window, or to change the sounds used in the game.  Changing the options in the Extras tab does not affect the rules of the game.
* Screen Background
The box framing the "Screen Background" list box shows the current background color of the screen.  Highlighting the name of a color in the list box will preview the new background color of the game window.
* Game Sounds
    * Game Sounds Enabled
The "Game Sounds Enabled" check box turns the game sounds on or off .  This option is checked on by default.  Un-checking the box will turn the game sounds off.  If this option is turned off, the rest of the controls below it are disabled.
If your system does not have any sound support (i.e. you are not using a windows-hosted sound card), this option will not be available.
* Path...
The Path... button allows you to choose a sound file to be played during a game event.  The game events that can have sounds attached are listed above the button.  You can associate any windows wave file (*.WAV) with a game event.
* Test
The Test button plays the sound associated with the game event selected in the list box above the button.  If there is no sound associated with the event, or the selected file is invalid, no sound will be played.
