# Bulldozer

The bulldozer will not move if one of the following three conditions are true:

**(1) You are trying to push multiple rocks...**

	You can only push one rock at a time!

**(2) You are pushing against a wall. . .**

	The bulldozer can't move through walls.

**(3) You are pushing a rock against a wall. . .**

	Be careful about pushing rocks against walls. The rock might become stuck, and you'll be forced to restart
	the level.

	However, it may still be possible to reach the target depending on its position.

## Completing a Level
Progress to the next level by moving all of the rocks on to the targets. Each level will have the same number of rocks as targets.

<br>

## Hints
Carefully plan your moves. It's easy to get stuck which may force you to restart the level.

A rock is not locked into position once it is placed on a target.
